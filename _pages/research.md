* ["Priorities and Effectiveness in Wildfire Management: Evidence from Fire Spread in the Western United States"](/files/priorities_and_effectiveness.pdf) (with Andrew Plantinga and Randy Walsh) [submitted]

	* Within the western United States, wildfire activity and costs of fighting wildfires have increased substantially over the past several decades. Yet surprisingly little is known about the effectiveness of wildfire suppression on large fires or about how wildfire incident managers use their significant discretion to prioritize resources threatened in wildfire incidents. We investigate priorities and effectiveness of wildfire suppression using a novel empirical strategy that compares 1,500 historical fire perimeters with the spatial distribution of assets at risk to identify determinants of wildfire suppression efforts. We find that fires are more likely to stop spreading as they approach homes, particularly when those homes are of higher value. This effect of threatened assets persists after controlling for physical factors (fuels, landscape, and weather) using outputs from a state-of-the-art wildfire simulation tool, and the probability that fire spread will be halted is affected by characteristics of homes 1–2 km from a fire’s edge. Our results provide evidence that wildfire suppression can substantively affect outcomes from wildfires but that some groups may benefit more from wildfire management than others.


* ["Inequality in Agency Responsiveness: Evidence from Salient Wildfire Events"](/files/agency-responsiveness.pdf) (with Sarah Anderson and Andrew Plantinga) [submitted, [coverage in the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/16/climate/wildfires-minorities-aid.html)]

	* We frequently assume, and some evidence has shown, that in a democratic system public participation in governmental decisions leads to better outcomes. In this paper, we use plausibly exogenous focusing events, which raise the salience of an issue among the public, to show that public agency decision-making based on public demands can raise equity concerns. Focusing specifically on the case of wildfires and wildfire risk management in the western U.S., we find that when communities experience nearby wildfire events, it raises the salience of wildfire risk and leads agencies to place a greater number of wildfire risk reduction projects nearby. However, salience-based decision-making does not benefit all communities equally. We find that nearby fires increase rates of fuel treatment particularly among whiter and more highly educated com- munities. Although there is growing evidence of inequality in legislative representation, this is the first evidence we know of showing that public agencies perpetuate inequality, via the behavioral biases of the public.

* "Wildfire threatens outdoor recreation in the Western US" (with Jacob Gellman and Margaret Walls) [[slides](/files/aere-camping-slides.pdf)]

	* Wildfire activity in the western US is increasing as outdoor recreation is growing in popularity and economic importance. Camping activity tends to coincide with fire season; however, relatively little is known about the impacts of fire on recreation. This study assesses behavioral responses of outdoor recreationists to wildfire and smoke in the western US. We link individual campground transactions from Recreation.gov, which details 25 million transactions at over 1,000 federally-managed campgrounds over the past ten years to daily satellite data on smoke and wildfire activity. The research highlights the potential for recreation reservation records to contribute to a growing body of work that uses large-scale regional or national to study recreation demand. In the presence of fire and smoke, campers cancel more trips and make fewer new reservations. Still, a strikingly high proportion of recreationists are exposed to smoke each year. From 2008 to 2016, 15.9% of visitor-days were affected by smoke, including 28.5% of unique visitors. About 2.6% of visitors camped within 20 km of an active fire. These findings highlight the growing impacts of wildfire on human activity in the west.

* "The Distributional Incidence of Wildfire Hazard in the Western United States" (with Molly Robertson)

	* Increases in wildfire activity in the western United States in recent years have led to significant property loss in wildland-urban interface areas, raising difficult questions for policymakers regarding who should bear these costs. Yet the distributional incidence of wildfire hazard is not well understood, despite its relevance for current policy debates related to wildfire and increased attention to how environmental and climate-related risks are distributed across socioeconomic groups. This paper fills this gap by combining property-level data on locations and values of residential properties, demographics, wildfire hazard, and historical wildfire perimeters. We find that while there is substantial heterogeneity within high wildfire hazard areas, wildfire risk to properties is disproportionately borne by high-income, white, and older residents, and owners of high-value properties. Properties whose value is the highest ten percent among properties in the same county are on average seventy percent more likely to be in high wildfire hazard areas than median value properties. Twenty percent of properties within 2011-2018 fire perimeters were in the top decile for property value among homes in the same county. 

* "Access Issues Exacerbate Wildfire on Public Lands" (with Bryan Leonard and Andrew Plantinga)

	* Wildfire activity in the western United States has been increasing since the 1970s, with many fires occurring on land managed by government agencies. Significant areas of public lands are surrounded by private land and lack road access, making them legally inaccessible to federal and state agencies and potentially constraining management and suppression of wildfires. In this paper, we assemble data on all fires that started on public lands in the western US over the period 1992--2015 and estimate the effect of legal accessibility on fire size. We find that ignitions are 14-23% more likely to become large if they occur on inaccessible land. We provide evidence that this effect may be driven in part by agencies' inability to conduct fuels management and in part by slower suppression responses.
